Our basic wedding service starts at $2995. It includes all the following:



	
  * Full photographic coverage of your wedding day with two photographers. There is no hourly limit; we work around your unique timeline.

	
  * An engagement session. This is critical to our relationship with you, and will make your wedding experience _much_ smoother.

	
  * Something we like to call "pre-wedding support." We will visit the wedding site(s) with you to plan the photography goals, and help you with your timeline.

	
  * An online gallery, so you can order prints or other products from your couch. You can also share this gallery with anyone you like, so they can order prints from their couches, _without having to go through you_.

	
  * ALL of your fully-retouched images on disc. We feel it's important that you be in control of your images.




We also offer the following products a la carte. You may purchase credit towards any of these items at a 25% discount before your wedding date.











	
  * Apart from each other, an album is the most important thing you have once the wedding is over. It is the tangible thing that will transport you back to that day 10, 20, or 30 years later. We create heirloom albums that will tell the story of your day, and we have many size and style options available.

	
  * Additional, smaller albums for gifts. Parents and grandparents love these. These are only available with the purchase of a full-size album.

	
  * Everyone loves to have prints. Our professional lab produces _gorgeous_ archival prints, in any size from wallet to wall, and on paper, aluminum, or canvas.

	
  * Save-the-date cards, thank-you cards, and other stationery, featuring your photos.

	
  * Photographic coverage of the rehearsal, dinner, or other related events.





If you have any questions about any of this, or want to book us immediately and without delay, [let's talk about it](http://beta.beckyjenson.com/contact).
