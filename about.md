#### People are beautiful when they are laughing.

I believe that being photographed is something to be enjoyed, not endured. Being with me is fun and easy.

#### People are beautiful when they are part of the great outdoors.

I believe in nature and fresh air. I use this gorgeous planet as my backdrop.

#### People are beautiful when they love.

I believe in love. There is a love story in every Session, and I strive to find it.
