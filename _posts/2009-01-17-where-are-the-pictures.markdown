So I have been hinting around that I did indeed get the Panasonic LX3 for Christmas and have been playing around with it here and there. (Love my "big" cameras, but also really needed a great "pocket" camera to just have on hand.) So why am I not posting my images? It seems we are not set up with the proper card reader yet so everything is just stuck in the camera...but we are working on it and in the meantime I will keep shooting and soon, I promise, there will be new picture-full blog posts :)
