We just got back from a site visit at the Camas Meadows Golf Course with a cool couple.  We got a tour of the golf course in a jouncy golf cart built for 6. It was quite fun and we got a great view of the course and all the awesome backdrops for the shots we will take on the day. It was very inspiring, not to mention zipping around on a golf cart is very cooling on a hot evening. I have never golfed before but I definitely enjoyed that part. We're excited for the chance to get to shoot their wedding here in August!
