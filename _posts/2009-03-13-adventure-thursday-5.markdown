Confession time: I'm wierdly obsessed with the I-5 Bridge.  I love it.  I love driving over it, love that it is rugged and beautiful and original.  I've often photographed it from a distance, admiring its delicate curves and blocky drawbrige, but today we got up close and personal.  We walked all the way across into Oregon on the southbound side then back again on the northbound side.  It was crazy loud, windy and precarious.  It bounces with the traffic and we had to tuck in behind the beams every time a biker came by.  I loved every minute :)
