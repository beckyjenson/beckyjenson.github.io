Beck and I spent saturday cramming in as much Tokyo as we could before she headed back to the real world. We started by heading out to [Kamikura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura,_Kanagawa) to the beach and to see a really big statue of Buddha, then we headed back to Tokyo to take a tour of the [Yebisu Beer Museum](http://www.sapporobeer.jp/english/guide/yebisu/), to go up the [Tokyo Tower](http://www.tokyotower.co.jp/english/) and see the [Roppongi district](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roppongi). After a long day we headed back to Omiya to grab some sushi and get some rest before Becky's long travel day on Sunday.
