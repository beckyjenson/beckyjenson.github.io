We spent Memorial Day weekend down in Dallas this year visiting friends of ours and doing their engagement photos and helping with their Hawaii wedding details.  It was a short trip, but we got a pretty nice glimpse of a city new to us.  We had delicious Tex-Mex & BBQ and spent a day at Six Flags.  I seem to have two modes when it comes to photography: either I am taking pictures, lots of pictures, OR I'm hardly shooting at all and just immersing myself in whatever we are doing.  Other than the engagement session, I hardly remembered to bring out the camera...here's the few non-portraits I took :)

Our friends + good Q + giant beers = awesome
