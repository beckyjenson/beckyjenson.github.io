Grace & I traveled up to Tacoma on a lovely sunny day last week to participate in the happy celebration of M’s first birthday. Simple beach party with family and friends. It doesn’t get much better than that! And little M is such a cutie ![:)](http://blog.bagdanoffphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
