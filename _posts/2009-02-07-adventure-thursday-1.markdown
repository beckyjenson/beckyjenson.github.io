 In this "slower" time of year I am trying to get out more and do more personal shooting and getting Grace more varied shooting experiences.  Thus we came up with Adventure Thursdays.  This week we headed out for a nice hike at Round Lake in Camas, WA.  The light that morning was horribly flat and dull, but we still had a great time and found some interesting sights.  Here are a few of my images:
