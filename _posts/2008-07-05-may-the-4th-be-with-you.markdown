One of our fun upcoming wedding clients surprised us with Comcast VIP tickets to the 4th of July celebration out at Fort Vancouver. We spent a very relaxing afternoon/evening chilling out with them in the VIP area, eating good food, drinking fine NW beers and talking about all things wedding. A short trip to the midway and B scored a fuzzy new friend that we all had to emulate.

When we arrived and looked through the program we saw a familiar band name: [Intervision](http://www.intervisionmusic.com/). This was a pleasant surprise since Mike & I grew up with the bass player and we hadn’t had an opportunity to see them live since we moved down. When they came on, we made our way through the masses to watch their lively set then returned to the VIP area for burgers & dogs.

Unfortunately, we couldn’t actually stay for the fireworks due to the fact that we had to drive up to Everett to get a good night’s sleep before our Saturday Smokey Point wedding. More on that later.
