Things are nice and slow here at Bagdanoff Photo.  We are gearing up for the year and doing some remodeling in anticipation of our move out to Washougal.  In the mean-time, here are some pics from a hike we did out at Round Lake in Camas a couple weeks ago.  (And yes, in that 3rd image they are consulting their phones for trail map information.  Even in the middle of the woods the phones come out :) )
