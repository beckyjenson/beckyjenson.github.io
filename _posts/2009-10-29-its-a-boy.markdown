After losing both his puggy companions in the last two months along with being un-allowed in half the house due to a family member recovering from surgery, Tucker the pug was starting to pine away and get depressed.  So we headed to the Humane Society yesterday to possibly pick up a muttly companion for him and luck upon luck ended up going home with Digby, a perfectly healthy, well-adjusted, handsome 2 1/2 year old bundle of  snuggles.  (He was given up due to allergies, the HS workers were THRILLED he was going to be with "pug people")  Welcome home Digby!
