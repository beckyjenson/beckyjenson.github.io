As was briefly mentioned in a previous post, I found myself in Virginia this October. The trip's purpose was 3-fold: Guest shoot a wedding with [Jenn Repp](http://jennrepp-photography.com/), visit my brother and his cute [family](http://inbetween.bagdanoffphoto.com/2008/10/virginia-family-portraits.html), and drive the incomparable [Skyline Drive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline_Drive) (one more off my [bucket list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_list)). Those three days of solitude in one of the most beautiful places I have ever been were just what I needed after the crazy-busy summer we had. What I found though, as I was driving and hiking through all this loveliness, was that I just wasn't very moved to photograph. Every time I made the effort to contain in-camera what I was witnessing, it felt somewhat diminished. So finally I decided that I needed to simply BE there and enjoy it all just for myself. That said, I did take some photos...all while hiking and all with the lightest of my lenses, my 14mm :)
