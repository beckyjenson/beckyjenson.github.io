[Rose Villa](http://rosevilla.org/index.html) down in Portland is celebrating 50 years!  What better way to commemorate than to gather a bunch of the residents and staff and take a neat portrait.  This image came together so easily and was a lot of fun, complete with climbing ladders, wearing a mike for the video, dancing around on a roof, and making lots of jolly senior citizens laugh.
