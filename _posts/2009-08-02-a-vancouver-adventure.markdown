Yesterday we went all over the Vancouver area to capture the wedding day of D&T. Becky spent the morning hanging out at the mall with the bride and her girls and I ran around a golf course with the groom and his guys. Then we met up at the Academy for portraits and the ceremony. We then drove in a motorcade out to Battleground for the reception. The couple were full of laughter, happiness and love and were surrounded by their friends and family in the gorgeous new Battleground Community Center.
