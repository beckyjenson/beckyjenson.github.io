I am an admitted gadget freak,  I love technology and toys and well designed devices, both as functional tools and also just to look at 'cuz they are pretty.  This photography business has given me endless justification for buying expensive and cool toys and that is just one more reason why I love this job. We recently picked up a couple of awesome devices that I wanted to share because I love them so much.

The first is Becky's new [Wacom Intuos 4 Medium](http://www.wacom.com/intuos/medium.php) tablet. This sleek input device replaces the Intuos 3 that I got her 3 years ago. A tablet is a must for anyone who does anything with Photoshop and the I4 is the best tablet out there. I like the fact that the buttons are all on one side now and the little OLED displays that show what each button is set to is quite possibly the most useful feature ever, making the buttons actually useful for someone like me who is extraordinarily forgetful. The touch ring has a button in the middle that can switch it from scroll to zoom to swap layers in Photoshop, etc. One added bonus (I think) is that the mouse is fairly crappy compared to the I3 mouse which has forced Becky to get used to just using the pen exclusively like I do.  It has a wide aspect ratio which matches her 24" display perfectly and quite importantly, the I4 Medium gives a big enough surface to map to her large display without any jitter.

 The second (and technically third) new gadget are our new [Kindle 2.0](http://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=CCujfoQDxSYqiIJW4tQPi6Ij-BNP1gHSV2pTHCMm4i9kSCAAQAVC1mpmO-_____8BYMmG_ovMpNQZyAEBqgQZT9BirGqIrcUw7ds8AVNlZ97iOrGevhLszg&ggladgrp=4636010976121908061&gglcreat=11632734165303808792&sig=AGiWqtx39tozQPrbdNiK3sn2LdJBf24zfQ&q=http://www.amazon.com/b/%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D133141011%26tag%3Dgooghydr-20%26hvadid%3D2205084821%26ref%3Dpd_sl_3zcpi94r97_e) e-readers. We are voracious readers and have been ever since we were children growing up in the oddly clean streets of Oregon City (there wasn't really a lot to do). Becky usually has several books going at once and I burn through a metric ass-ton of Sci-Fi.  When Becky wanted one I was skeptical but after she got it and I got to play with it for a little, I got online and picked one up myself. Not only does it have a great form factor for reading, lightweight and pretty sexy to hold, the built-in Internet on the Sprint network gives me access to the web nearly everywhere I go for free. The killer feature for me is the text-to-speech function. When I get in the car, I plug the headphone jack into my stereo and press the shift-symbol hot key and whatever book I am reading starts reading itself to me while I drive.
