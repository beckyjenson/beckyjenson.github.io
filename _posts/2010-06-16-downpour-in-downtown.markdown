My soggiest portrait session to date!  I had all these great backgrounds chosen on the grounds of the Portland Art Museum and the Park Blocks.  But sadly, the day dawned wet and pouring.  By the time everyone arrived and the session began the rain was just dumping down.  So, on to my backup spot.  A neutral overhang area provided by a nearby church.  And look!  Still a great session, lots of smiles, and a fun experience overall.  Flexibility makes for a happy family and a happy photographer.  (Note: while I kept my smiling family dry and under cover, myself and my assistant were in the downpour sporting our new rain-resistant fleece hoodies.  They worked pretty well!)
