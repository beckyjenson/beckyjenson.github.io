Here are the results from last weekend's short trip to Dallas!  The first dog shots are a miracle as sweet N wanted nothing to do with being still and everything to do with investigating the ducks, but isn't she cute?  This little greenspace was full of litter and even housed a sleeping bum, but I can work magic with any location and we ended up with a great nature-style first half.

I don't know a thing about Dallas, so I asked for "gritty, colorful, full of texture" and they took us to the Deep Ellum neighborhood.  So awesome, everywhere I looked my head nearly exploded from all the color, texture and grittyness.  Well done guys :)

Then we went into the heart of downtown to play around with a giant artwork called Proverb, by Mark di Suvero, just outside the Dallas Symphony Hall.  Overall a great shoot, with more inspiration than I knew what to do with.
