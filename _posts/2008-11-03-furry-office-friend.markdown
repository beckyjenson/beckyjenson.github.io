Our building is dog-friendly, but I never got around to bringing in one of our three pugs until today. Tucker and I walked in to work together this morning for the first time. 2.2 miles, a rainshower and 5473 pee stops later we made it in. It took him awhile to settle down, but now he’s made himself at home, and for today at least, Grace & I have a funny little furry face to brighten the day ![:)](http://bagdanoffphoto.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
