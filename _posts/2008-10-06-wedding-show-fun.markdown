We spent the day at the Portland/Vancouver Wedding Expo out at the Clark County Fairgrounds today. We were unable to host our own booth yesterday as we had a wedding to shoot but our friends Amanda & Michelle volunteered to help us out for the day. We enjoyed meeting new people and talking to new brides about their plans. Here is a picture of me behaving silly:
