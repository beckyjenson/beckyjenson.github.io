Scheduling an outdoor shoot in the Spring in the gorgeous Northwest is tricky, very tricky.  On the one hand we get green everywhere, beautiful soft light, puffy white clouds.  But in between all that loveliness is the ever present rain or at least the threat of rain.  After a few stops and starts we settled on a time and location (Wilsonville Memorial Park.)  We were each coming from about an hour in opposite directions and the weather was awesome, then awful, then awesome and so on.  We got to the park early to quickly walk around and find our "inspiration spots", watching the dark clouds on all sides.  When A&P arrived we were given a rain break that lasted exactly as long as their 90 minute session (we even had some actual sun!)  It started to rain just as we were heading back to the cars.  A&P are so insanely adorable and so insanely into each other, they were a total delight to photograph.  We all had a great time traipsing around the park and laughing at each other's antics.  We are really looking forward to their wedding this summer!

The upper left shot is my absolute favorite of the entire group.

The orange that they wore contrasts so incredibly against the stunning greens of the season.

When they looked at each other, magic happened.

Every girl should be so lucky to have hair like this...
