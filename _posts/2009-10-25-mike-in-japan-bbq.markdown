Saturday Wacom Japan held its annual BBQ party out in some park in Urawa, Saitama. We had much meat, much sake and much beer. I also met more foreigners there than I have seen my entire time in Japan, proving that Wacom has really become a global company. I had a chance to talk to many people in different areas of the company and there were even some english speaking spouses there as well. All in all it was a terrific day and when I finally stumbled in the apartment at 4 I was still a little tipsy and so passed out for 3 hours.
