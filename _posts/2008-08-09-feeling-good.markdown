We had a great time out at the Camas Meadows Golf Course yesterday with the vibrant H&C. They were an incredibly fun couple to work with and the event was, as a whole, outstanding.  The day was repeatedly punctuated with shocking pink as the Bride incorporated her signature color into all of the lovely details that appeared everywhere.
