We are finally to that time of year where we get a social life again! We gathered together a seriously fun group for a bowling night over at Big Al’s in Vancouver on Monday. In addition to Mike & I, there was our amazing assistant Grace and her husband, a co-worker of Mike’s from Wacom, dear old friends who also happened to be our “Thou Art Awesome” wedding, and some new friends who we met while participating in their “More Than Words” wedding. All in all a great time was had by everyone! If any of you dear readers are interested in joining us for future gatherings let us know…

PS: these were all taken with my (crappy) little Canon point and shoot camera. My Christmas wish this year? The [panasonic LX3](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/573592-REG/Panasonic_DMC_LX3K_Lumix_DMC_LX3_Digital_Camera.html), for when my big camera is just too big to carry around all the time ![:)](http://bagdanoffphoto.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
