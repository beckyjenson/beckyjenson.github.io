One of my gorgeous brides this season asked for a special shoot that would result in a book she could give her husband on their wedding day. That amazing day is now a wonderful memory and lovely Melissa here has given me permission to post a small sampling from our session. These were all taken with just window light and a reflector and all in her hair studio! It was fun to go outside my normal shooting range and create something different.
