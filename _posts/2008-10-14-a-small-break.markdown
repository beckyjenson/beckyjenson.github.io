I'm out in gorgeous Virginia right now. Partly for a visit with my brother & his family, partly to guest shoot another wedding with the lovely and talented [Jenn Repp](http://www.jennrepp-photography.com), and partly to fulfil a dream of an East Coast Autumn Drive. Here is the view from my window at the Skyland Lodge in the center of the incredible Shenandoah National Park. A couple more days of this loveliness before I head back home.
