One of the main points of me coming to Japan was to meet the team and learn how they do their jobs. A large part of what they do is mock-up sample hardware for testing and driver development. To demonstrate this they offered to show me how to convert my laptop into a tabletPC. Unfortunately, what I brought with me has too large a screen to put a pen digitizer in and not enough room to put a touch panel in. So we grabbed a [Cintiq 12WX](http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/cintiq-12wx.php), which is normally a Pen-only display and put a 2-finger touch panel on it.

The process started with lengthy soldering practice, since I never really did anything like this before it took some time (and 4 test boards) before I got the process of editing resistors and capacitors and IC chips down. I was given instructions on what edits had to be made to convert the controller board from a serial connection to USB. After that was done, I moved to disassembling the Cintiq and installing the new touch panel, after some discussion (mostly in Japanese so I didn't understand it) it was decided not to try combining the cables, but to just make another USB port on the Cintiq so the touch panel would have its own plug. I did some case editing with this awesome vibrating superknife and put the whole thing back together and added a hacky little grey mask around the edges because the new glass doesn't fit where the old glass went.

All in all it was a great learning experience and I kinda want to do more. I wonder if I can find some stuff around our house to mess with.
