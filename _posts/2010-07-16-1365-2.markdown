I've decided to step up the Daily Photo (which wasn't really daily).  I am starting my own 365 photo project and making it public, here, where it will be seen and monitored!  I have been wanting to start a 365 project for some time now, but kept getting hung up on January 1st being the logical start date, and then just missing it.  So today is day one, simple as that.  Every day I will take at least one photo to post.  (It may not always, 100%, get online the same day, due to internet issues that sometimes crop up, but I will always shoot something.)  My pro cameras, my Lx3 and my phone all will be recruited, along with the random disposable camera I may pick up (they can be quite fun.)

So without further ado, here's photo number one: my little guy, Jackson.  (He will probably appear again.  No, he definitely will appear again...)
