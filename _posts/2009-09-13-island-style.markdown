Our close friends were wed on 09/09/09 in Hawaii and since the groom was the one who introduced Becky and I, we of course offered to shoot their wedding.  We spent a week in Kona relaxing, sweating, swimming, sweating and of course being hot with a bunch of old friends from high school. We made some new friends and shot an amazing wedding on the beach and party (well, several parties the whole week) on the beautiful grounds of the [Ohana Retreat](http://www.ohanaretreat.com/).
