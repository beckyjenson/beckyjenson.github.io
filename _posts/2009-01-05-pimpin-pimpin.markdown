[](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_LKUTVCjSnWg/SWLkD5xUR_I/AAAAAAAAAFk/sIlkt_1_KC4/s1600-h/P1000047.JPG)Â We hung out at the Vancouver/Portland Wedding Expo this weekend and talked to soon-to-be brides and grooms for all of saturday and sunday. We lugged some comfy leather chairs in and hooked up a fake fireplace and made a little living room area to show off our gallery wraps, albums and slideshow. We talked to alot of great people and booked a couple weddings right there. From the interest that our booth generated we are looking at a full and fun wedding season.
