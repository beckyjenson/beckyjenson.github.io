This is my glorious shooting field. 




And this is my big brushy, log-filled woodpile.  It's spent the last several months just sitting there, soaking up all the rain and impeding the growing grass.  We try to chip away at it, but it's a tangled, daunting mess.  Last weekend we hooked some of the bigger logs up to the Jeep and drug them out, thus creating two piles...  Who ever thought that running a photography business would also involve logging?
