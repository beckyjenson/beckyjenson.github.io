Our last wedding of 2008 was the most original by far! A Beaver and a Duck fell in love and decided to get married with a Civil War theme. We headed down to Corvallis for their simple and lovely morning ceremony held at Bar 101. After some seriously fun portraits around the picturesque downtown we all headed over the their tailgate reception party. The day culminated with the Big Game. The weather was perfect and the day was filled with fun, good friends, lighthearted rivalries and of course, lots of love.
