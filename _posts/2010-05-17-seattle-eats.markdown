_This post is from my old blog (from last April) but it fits the theme of today's [Shutter Sisters](http://shuttersisters.com/home/2010/5/17/served.html) post.  I am glad I looked it up, what a great memory to revisit._

Last weekend I was up in Seattle to help my dear friend celebrate her birthday.  She took me to this fabulous place up on Phinney Ridge: [Picnic](http://www.picnicseattle.com/) a food+ wine boutique.  Super fun to browse, all sorts of yummy food and wine just begging to be taken on a picnic.  Our day wasn't so lovely, so we opted to sit along the counter lined with windows.  When our meal arrived I was so taken by the gorgeous colors and simple presentation I HAD to bust my camera out.  Pictured below is the incredibly delicious roasted butternut + acorn squash soup; the tomato, herbed crouton + pimenton soup; and a perfectly balanced cheese plate.  Foodie delight.
