Our pug MuShu is 14 years old today. That's really old for a pug, but over all she is quite healthy and, dare I say, downright sprightly. She came to us 4 years ago under sad circumstances, so we have only known her as an "old lady".  However, I can't imagine the last 4 years without having her around. She is exactly between our other 2 pugs in terms of size and temperament and when they are all together (which is almost constantly) she is always in the middle. When she barks in her deep and raspy old-lady-smoker voice she actually says "arf" and "ruff". MuShu has proven to be completely fearless, agile like a cat, and is an expert at finding the most comfortable place to lay down in ANY situation. She is totally awesome.
