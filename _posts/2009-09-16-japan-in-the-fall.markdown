So, I will be going to Japan for the month of October for my day job. This will be a great opportunity to explore the culture and learn more about the company that I work for ([Wacom](http://www.wacom.com)). Becky will be joining me for the last 3 weeks and we will be bringing our cameras and doing a lot of stock, landscape and travel-type photography. We will be hectically making our arrangements for the trip (that we heard about yesterday) in the next two weeks. We will update the blog often with images of our adventures but in the meantime, here is a picture of a idyllic Japanese temple thingy
