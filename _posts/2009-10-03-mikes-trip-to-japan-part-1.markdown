I am sitting in [my apartment in Omiya](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.903081,139.632851&num=1&t=h&sll=35.906322,139.623601&sspn=0.036155,0.06403&ie=UTF8&start=0&hq=&hnear=%EF%BC%92%E4%B8%81%E7%9B%AE%EF%BC%92%EF%BC%91+%EF%BC%95%E6%B5%85%E9%96%93%E7%94%BA,+%C5%8Cmiya+Ward,+Saitama+City,+Saitama+Prefecture,+Japan&ll=35.903072,139.632898&spn=0.000324,0.000707&z=21), sippin' on a Coke and eating some Pocky, pondering how the crap I got here. For the uninformed, by day I am a humble software engineer, toiling at the code mills providing drivers and OEM support for [Wacom](http://www.wacom.com/). When they started up a employee exchange program I signed up immediately.  Becky and I have always wanted to not only visit other countries but actually live in them instead of just being a tourist. I was one of 10 employees worldwide chosen to relocate for 1-2 months to the region of their choosing. I chose Japan since the hardware and firmware teams that I commonly work with are located here and so off I flew, for 11 torturous hours (I am not a small man and the Boeing 767 is quite tiny for a transpacific vehicle). 

I arrived last night, met at the airport by my friend Tatsu, who is a project manager at Wacom Japan, and Abe-san who is an HR manager for Wacom. After showing me to my apartment (see below) and spending some time figuring out the internet (and failing), we went to a local restaurant for some dinner (or breakfast for me). I finally crawled into "bed" after 25 hours awake and slept fairly well.

This morning Tatsu came over and we headed out to do some shopping, I bought some groceries and some necessities like a towel and a drinking glass. We had a delicious udon lunch and I headed back to the apartment. Not sure what I will do tonight, (it is Saturday here, yes I am typing this from the future) but it may be a low key movie night or I may try to get drunk and lost in the city.

This whole thing was very sudden, we didn't know whether I was going or when until mid September and Becky already had some work lined up for this weekend and a trip to Vegas next week so she will be coming on the 12th to stay for one week. Unfortunately (for everyone involved) her best friend is having some health issues and so Becky will be returning on the 18th to help her through that. I, or what is left of me, will be returning on October 31st and will be updating the blog with various tales of my time as the Big American Guy in Omiya, unless I am deported early.

I only brought the LX3 with me and have taken some pictures to kinda set the stage.

All in all it is pretty comfortable and I should get along fine. That is all for now, expect more in the next week or so.
