Having arrived at [Northwest River Park](http://www.chesapeake.va.us/services/depart/park-rec/nwrp/index.shtml) in Virginia in the complete dark, we had no idea just how gorgeous our campground really was.  It was also very very wet.  There was no fire for us, so we ate cold dinner leftovers in the car with the heater on.  As we were checking out we decided to delay our day's plans and rent a canoe for an hour!  So lovely, so calm.  We then drove south to the Outer Banks in North Carolina.

After checking in to our B&B we went on a hike in the [Nags Head Woods Ecological Preserve](http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/northcarolina/preserves/art5618.html).  Swampy and pretty.  A great way to stretch legs that have spent the day in the car.
