On Thursday, Grace & I took a trip to the [Oregon Zoo](http://www.oregonzoo.org/) in Portland with the thought that it would be a less crowded time to go as school wasn't out for the summer.  We were wrong.  It turns out it was school field trip day and the park was innundated with groups of kids in matching shirts or nametags running to and fro.  It was chaos.  We managed to get a little shooting in, but it was hard to even hear each other talk let alone get close enough for shooting!  I had on my favorite lens, 70-200mm, so was able to sneak some shots over the heads of all the kids.  We will go back, but will try to plan better :)

This penguin was behind thick zoo glass, I'm pleased with the clarity of the image.

The lorikeet habitat was where our best shooting happened, as they limited the amount of people in at one time.

He appears wise.  And he was ignoring a young one yelling at him from just under his branch.
