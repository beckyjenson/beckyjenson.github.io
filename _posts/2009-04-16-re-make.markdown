This entry is inspired by today's post on [Shutter Sisters](http://shuttersisters.com).  They talk about doing re-makes, or simply being inspired by other artists.  The following image of Mike & MuShu was done years ago for a school assignment: to recreate the work of a famous photographer.  I used [this image ](http://www.montville.net/highschool/spflugmoench/AL_William_Wegman__Fay_Ray_1988.jpg)of [William Wegman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wegman_(photographer)) done by [Annie Leibovitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Leibovitz).  Obviously my proportions are skewed, but it adds to the humor of the image :)
