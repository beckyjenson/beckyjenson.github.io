Yesterday we headed north at 2:30pm with the semi-robotic voice of Mike's [kindle](http://blog.bagdanoffphoto.com/?p=1129) "reading" [World War Z](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z) to us.  At about 5:30 we were enjoying something Portland/Vancouver CANNOT seem to get right: Teriyaki.  We got our fix (ok, it's Mike who REALLY needed the fix) at [Yak's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/yaks-teriyaki-seattle) in the SODO area.  This is where he would order extra-spicy teriyaki almost every single day for 3 years as he worked 1/2 a block away.  After eating AND getting an order to take home, we headed up to downtown Seattle and picked up our tickets to [Flight of the Conchords ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Conchords)at the gorgeous [Paramount](http://www.theparamount.com/) (the last concert we saw there was [Tenacious D](http://www.tenaciousd.com/)...we like our novelty bands).  We had a little time to kill, so we walked around downtown a bit, enjoying the sun, but getting chilled by the seriously heavy wind.  There was a bit of nostalgia felt.  The concert was fantastic, even if our seats weren't.  [Arj Barker](http://www.arjbarker.com/) opened with some of his stand-up routine.  The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra joined FOTC onstage for several of their songs.   Then we drove home with a stop in [Fife](http://www.cityoffife.org/) (the Gateway City) for sour gummy worms, hot cheetos, and red bull.  We spent more time driving than actually in Seattle, but it was worth it.

This is my non-spicy teriyaki, but the best part of this is the "pink rice".
