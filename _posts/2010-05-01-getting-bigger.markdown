I have been photographing this little guy (and his big brother) since they were both born.  (And mom and dad since their engagement...)  Here he is now a big 9-month-old, suffering mightily from a bad cold, but still being a good sport.  This is also the first official session in my new home out in Washougal.  The weather didn't cooperate for an outdoor shoot, but my daylight room worked beautifully!
