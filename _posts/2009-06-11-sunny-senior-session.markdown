This was one of the fun sessions I arranged during my last Seattle trip a couple weeks ago.  C will be a senior in the fall and as she had a very busy summer planned wanted to get her Senior Portrait Session done early.  All shooting was done on her family's property and the neighbor's.  So much variety and such a beautiful day!

Her beloved mare was celebrating her 5th birthday and got to star in some photos :)
