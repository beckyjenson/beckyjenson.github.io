While we were in the Finger Lakes Region of New York state in September I was mostly taking a break from all things photography (saving it all up for the wedding at the end of the week.)  That being said I did take my camera out a couple times.  Most of these images are from a very long walk we took around Lamoka Lake and the tiny town of Tyrone.  The cavernous image was taken at Watkins Glen State Park.
