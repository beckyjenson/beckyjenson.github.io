Being that it is springtime, and we were at the gorgeous but temperamental Oregon Coast, we weren't sure this session was going to be an outdoor one!Â  I'm so glad we persevered. We had but a small break in the rain and sun (but not the cold or wind!) and were able to very quickly create these adorable family beach vacation portraits.
