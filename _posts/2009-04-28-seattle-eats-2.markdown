Last weekend I was up in Seattle to help my dear friend celebrate her birthday.  She took me to this fabulous place up on Phinney Ridge: [Picnic](http://www.picnicseattle.com/) a food+ wine boutique.  Super fun to browse, all sorts of yummy food and wine just begging to be taken on a picnic.  Our day wasn't so lovely, so we opted to sit along the counter lined with windows.  When our meal arrived I was so taken by the gorgeous colors and simple presentation I HAD to bust my camera out.  Pictured below is the incredibly delicious roasted butternut + acorn squash soup; the tomato, herbed crouton + pimenton soup; and a perfectly balanced cheese plate.  Foodie delight.

The evening culminated at [El Chupacabra](http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/41682316/seattle_wa/el_chupacabra.html), for a fun birthday party.  The cake was homemade and is as moist and chocolaty as it looks :)
