So this morning I crammed on the train (literally as there were people up to the door, I just shoved some schoolgirls out of the way and took their place), whipped out my kindle and headed to Kurihashi. At one point the train emptied enough so I could sit down, still reading my book. A little bit later I looked up and saw that we were at a station I didn't recognize, I looked at the map and realized that I had blown past Kurihashi by 3 stations. I got off the train and jumped on the next train going the other way, arriving at Kurihashi just *after* the bus to the office left. So I got to experience a Japanese taxi this morning, luckily I just got in and said "Wacom" and he knew where to go.
