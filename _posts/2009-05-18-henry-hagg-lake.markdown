On Saturday we hopped on the motorcycle (1985 Honda Magna V65) and rode in the glorious NW sun down to [Henry Hagg Lake](http://www.co.washington.or.us/Support_Services/Facilities/Parks/Hagglake/index.cfm) to meet one of our [couples](http://blog.bagdanoffphoto.com/?p=1048) for a site visit.  We walked around the wedding site with them and talked about the light and where to do portraits and the various places to stage the ceremony.  They could not have picked a more gorgeous location!  We are excited about their wedding next month!  We then drove all the way around the lake and I took some "back of the bike" snaps with my [LX3](http://blog.bagdanoffphoto.com/?p=79).  Great afternoon adventure.
