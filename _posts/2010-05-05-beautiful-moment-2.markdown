This is an image of my best friend and her daughter.  I have lived with her and her young family since early September.  Later in that same month she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I have been there for every moment of [this journey](http://punchfight.straubnet.net/), from the first emergency room visit, the surgery and aftermath, the intensive chemo treatments, to her current radiation.   As I sometimes struggle to care for a cancer patient and a family and household that just dropped into my lap, I sometimes get too caught up in "caregiver mode" in order to just make it through the day.  It's moments like this morning, where I remember to see my best friend, to see what she is fighting for, that bring me back.  In this image there is a hint of her scars, the loss of her hair, the signs of the exhaustion caused by daily radiation.  But what shines forth from this image is a mother's love for her baby, a young woman's strength to go on, a toddler's delight in a happy shared moment with mommy.  I see my best friend as she is and I am reminded how honored I am to be a part of this family and how profoundly changed I have become.
