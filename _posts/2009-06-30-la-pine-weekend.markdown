This past weekend we met up with some friends and headed out to my parent's slice of land out [La Pine](http://www.lapine.org/), (central) Oregon.  They can't build on it yet, but it's a great woodsy and convenient place to camp and strike out exploring.  We had a fantastic weekend relaxing and hanging out.  I didn't even bring a "big" camera and only rarely busted out my LX3 (hey, I was on vacation), but here is some of the fun:

There is no real trail and you bring your own lights (and I am actually in this shot by Mike):

Even after having a slight panic attack going through the parts where you have to crawl on hands and knees I still wanted to do a fairly creative shot:
