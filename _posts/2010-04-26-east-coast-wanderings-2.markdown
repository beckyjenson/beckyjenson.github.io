Today we explored [Colonial Williamsburg](http://www.history.org/) (ate lunch with a Survivor contestant!) and [Jamestown Island](http://www.preservationvirginia.org/rediscovery/page.php?page_id=8).  The first was extremely touristy and contrived, the second was much calmer and more about the history and sense of place.  We also did the island drive and walked along the coastline.  It was interesting to imagine why the island was chosen as the first (surviving) settlement.
