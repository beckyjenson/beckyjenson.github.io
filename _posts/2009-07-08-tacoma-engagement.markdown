This gorgeous session at [Point Defiance Park](http://www.metroparkstacoma.org/page.php?id=24) in Tacoma was just one of the reasons for our Seattle trip a couple weeks ago.  I love shooting in this park!  So many amazing little corners and pops of color everywhere.  Of course, when we arrived they were setting up for the [Taste of Tacoma](http://www.tasteoftacoma.com/home/) festival, but you'd never know it by our images :)

It may be a park but there is still some urbanness to be found with cement and brick:

And yes, this park also has a fabulous beach:
