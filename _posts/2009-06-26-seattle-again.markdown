Another short Seattle trip for Mike & I.  Part one began Wednesday night with an engagement shoot at one of our favorite Tacoma parks, [Point Defiance](http://www.metroparkstacoma.org/page.php?id=24).  Watch for that post to appear soon.  Part two was hanging out in downtown Seattle enjoying some fine beers and company.  Part three happened Thursday morning in the form of a meeting with a couple of Seattle's finest wedding planners: [Michelle Engvall](http://marriedwithmichelle.blogspot.com/) and [Lisa Chambers](http://www.chambers-co.com/index2.php).  Part four involved stopping at Yak's in Sodo for several orders of Mike's favorite teriyaki, and finally part five was a stop in University Place to deliver some African artwork that I had creatively framed and matted for a dear client.  Then a long but satisfied drive home :)
