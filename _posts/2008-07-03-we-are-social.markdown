So we have always resisted social networking sites as we usually prefer to talk to people face to face or on the phone rather than messaging through myspace, etc. But now that the business is really picking up, we want to try to use every resource to help spread the word and one great way to do that is via these sites. So I created an account on a few of them and put some basic info in.


More customization and such will come later when I have time but in the meantime, look to the left of the page in the links section & check them out. If you belong to one of them, why not add us as a friend or connection or whatever.
