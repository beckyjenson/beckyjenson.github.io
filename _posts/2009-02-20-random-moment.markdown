It's my goal to update my blog more, so I am reaching into my archives to pull random moments to share.  This lovely shot is from a trip we took in June of 2005.  We drove almost the entire length of the Oregon Coast to test out our "new" 1983 Minnie Winnie.  This view is from a picnic stop in Ecola State Park, near Cannon Beach.
