It was a gorgeous Portland summer day, a bit hot, but the sun shone for M&D's lovely wedding. We got to shoot one of the final weddings to be held in the historic First Christian Church in downtown Portland. After the emotional ceremony the party walked down the Park Blocks to the awesome Adrianna Hill Ballroom. Although hot, hot, hot the dancing and partying went on all night and much fun was had!
