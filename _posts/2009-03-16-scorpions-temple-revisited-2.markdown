While the rest of the gang opted to spend the entire day in the rental car to see ruins, C and I stayed in Cancun and sought out the far less famous and much smaller Scorpion's Temple.  It was not easy to get to, as it was tucked between two hotels with no true public access.  (Although according to our guidebook, the ruins themselves were federal property and open to all.)  The temple is located on the highest piece of land on the entire island, and was believed to be a watchtower or lighthouse.  It was incredible to be standing next to ruins dated to approx 1200 A.D. while within spitting distance of incredibly modern and posh hotels.

After we had wandered around the ruins a bit and taken a bunch of pictures, I suddenly noticed a LARGE lizard sunning on a rock not 5 feet away.  Then we see another, and another.  Either we just didn't notice them at first, or they were converging...  At the time I was crawling around, climbing up rocks and generally being dangerous to get better views of the lizards I told C that I was calling this photo essay "Monsters Are Watching From Above".
