I spent saturday walking around the Akihabara district of Tokyo, an area filled with hundreds of electronics and entertainment shops. Tats and I went to many stores looking at cool gadgets and electronics. I left the area with a small bluetooth mouse for my laptop so I could plan Team Fortress 2 while I am here and Tats got some CDs and misc other things. We then went to Hibiya part where there was a train festival going on (we didn't know it was going to be there but it was interesting). We enjoyed a beer while walking around the park and then headed to the Imperial Palace and viewed, from a distance, where the Emperor of Japan lives. After a long day of walking the streets of Tokyo, we headed back to Omiya.
