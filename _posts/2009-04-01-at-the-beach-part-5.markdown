So this is the end of the first day of shooting.  Here we have "On the rocks and in the water".  It got really dark really fast.  At the very end my bravest model decided to get in the water while the rest looked on all wrapped in coats and towels :)  Of course, that means that I was in the water as well, but I had people looking out for me...
