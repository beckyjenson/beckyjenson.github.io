I am here, jet-lagged and on the tail end of a week in Vegas, but here with Mike now!  Took a bit of a walk yesterday to get my bearings.  Just took the Lx3 with me.  The thing about the area we are in is that it's a suburb of Tokyo, with really no tourists and not a lot of overt history.  The city is lovely though, and very very clean.  I found this great walking trail/park right down the middle of the city and followed it to a shrine of some sort.  Lots of informational signs...none I could read.

Me, baffled at all that I am seeing, but having no way to get the info I need!
