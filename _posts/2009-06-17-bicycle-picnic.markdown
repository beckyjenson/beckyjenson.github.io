A couple weeks ago we went on a Vancouver waterfront bike ride/picnic with a couple friends.  I completely forgot my camera, but borrowed theirs for a few shots.  (So keep in mind, this is NOT my camera, just my shooting...)  It was one of those amazing Northwest summer evenings where the blue is blinding and the sun isn't too hot :)

Taking it even further with a bit of help from Mike (notice "someone" throwing giant rocks off to the left)
