Beck arrived on Monday and we have been exploring the city together, last night we had a mini adventure worthy of bloggage. We wandered into a restaurant at random and sat down at what turned out to be a rather fancy place. We were further surprised by the lack of any useful pictures on the menu so we ordered some beer and gave it some thought. Eventually we decided to play menu roulette and just point to menu items and see what they bring us. After a shaky start with a plate of spam & vegetables, we had a delicious cheesy rice w/ salmon bowl and pizza with shrimp and sausage. We highly enjoyed the meal though we ordered too much since we were afraid something would be terrible, but we brought half of the pizza home with us. Near the end of the meal we heard what we thought was an explosion outside, turned out to be thunder and so we enjoyed the 30 minute walk home in a ridiculously heavy thunderstorm with lightning and crashing peals of thunder overhead. We arrived home soaked and tired, but enjoyed the evening immensely.
