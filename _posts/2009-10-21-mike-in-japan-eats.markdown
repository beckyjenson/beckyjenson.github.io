I have to make a special post about the food here. I enjoy food and I when I am on my own each meal is an adventure, the ordering process at someplace as familiar as McDonalds is still a challenge sometimes, not to mention when I choose a restaurant at random. Lunch is something special here, though. The Wacom corporate headquarters is way out in the countryside, so to speak, so there is nothing around to eat, mostly just more factories and fields. To address this issue, Wacom has a cafeteria with several dishes and two main entree choices a day. I have been surprised and delighted by the quality of the food and have enjoyed a great variety of Japanese meals and sides. And it is reasonably priced, a main dish, bowl of rice, miso and a vegetable side for 400 yen (about $4.50).

Sometimes the meal leaves me a little hungry come 4:00, with two hours left in the work day I need a snack and some quick energy. Enter the Cruch Choco Cake for the snack and the Kirin Afternoon Tea for the energy. Like many things here in Japan, they are not as cloyingly sweet as you would expect and are a refreshing afternoon snack. (Though I tend to drink like 2 or 3 of the teas through the course of the day)
