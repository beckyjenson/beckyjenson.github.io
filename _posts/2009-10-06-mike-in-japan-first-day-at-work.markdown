Yesterday was my first day at work. I awoke way too early, (my body clock is still a little offset) walked down to Omiya Station and bought a rail pass for the month. I then boarded the train and headed to Kurihashi. Once there I got on the Wacom provided bus that heads to the headquarters and Tatsu showed me around the place and to my desk area.
The day started off with a weekly status meeting that I didn't understand and I introduced myself, which many of them didn't understand. We then broke up into the individual teams and did the morning scrum meeting to say what we all are doing that day (a lot more incomprehension going on, mostly by me). I spent the day doing my normal work, went to a meeting with some customers from Austin, TX and had lunch with them then headed home.
In front of Kurihashi Station I met Nishihara-san, one of the sales representatives from the Tokyo office who was there meeting with the customers from Texas and he invited me into Shinjuku to have dinner with them. We rode for about an hour into Tokyo and went to a fine restaurant called [Hokkaido](http://r.gnavi.co.jp/g306019/)Â where we ate sashimi and various appetizers and drank the house beer. I stumbled home about 11:30 and fell quite asleep. Hopefully that helped fix my internal clock and I woke up around 6 this morning feeling like it was actually 6am.
