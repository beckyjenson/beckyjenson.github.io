We had an awesome time shooting A&J's wedding today at the lovely [Fairgate Inn](http://www.fairgateinn.com/).  We started off at Round Lake park, getting the first look and some wonderful portraits, then headed over to the Inn for the rest of the day. Everything was perfect, the love and laughter of the couple and the joy the family showed at their union was an honor to capture.  Their quirky and personal vows were heartwarming and hilarious, causing laughter and tears in equal amounts. Special thanks to the [City of Camas Fire Department](http://www.ci.camas.wa.us/fire/).
