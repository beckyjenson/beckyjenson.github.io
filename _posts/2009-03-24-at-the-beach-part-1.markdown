Way back last summer, before busy season attacked, I took some lovely former brides out to Rockaway beach for a fun/fashiony/experimental photo shoot.  I am finally getting around to processing the images and will be presenting them bit by bit as I have spare time.  Only one of these four lovely ladies is wearing her actual wedding dress, the rest we tracked down at local thrift stores.  I love doing "after" shoots with brides (and grooms, we did have guys there too).  So stay tuned, more will be coming!  We begin with the simple act of walking down to the beach...
