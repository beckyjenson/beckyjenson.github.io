Lets be honest, a lot of last night is a blur of food, booze and conversation. I had a great time going to a restaurant in Kurihashi with the engineering team and Yamada-san, the CEO of Wacom. I and a few of the team who live in Omiya or the surrounding area stumbled onto the train at 11:30 and I got home about 12:30. I am definitely not used to having such a long transit time (including a long walk) after being that intoxicated. I am a little hungover this morning but not bad, I think the stumble home helped clear my head before bed. I head off to Akihabara today to go look at gadgets and technology (glee).
