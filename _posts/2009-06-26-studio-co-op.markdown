After having two Portland offices spaces not pan out we decided to move the business side of the company back home and instead joined a studio co-op down by OMSI for a few months to gain some time in finding the absolute perfect new home for Bagdanoff Photo.  Studio 20 offers us 3 studio rooms to use for shooting as well as meetings.  I have a feeling that I will only ever be reserving the natural light room though :)  We'll be doing some playing around in this room over the next few months to help determine if having a daylight studio is a direction we want to go in.  On Wednesday Grace was actually the first to shoot there as I had to rush home and head up to Seattle with Mike.  I did take a few shots before I left though:
