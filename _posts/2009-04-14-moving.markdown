Yes, although we love this office and this building and Vancouver, the time has come to move up in the world.  We are currently seeking retail storefront space in one of several different Portland neighborhoods.  Until that perfect spot is found (we actually found it, twice now, but was beat to the punch both times) we are simply relocating to our home office.  This is a VERY temporary move though :)  Onwards and upwards we go!
