The weather has been outstanding here in the NW which means we all bring our pasty faces out into the sun.  On Tuesday we joined our friends on a motorcycle ride out to their future home site way, way out in Washougal for a picnic dinner.  Gorgeous ride in along the river, lovely views from the property, delicious food, fun company, and exploring the old out-buildings made for a fantastic evening.  (Topping it off with a rousing game of Settlers of Catan was just frosting.)

If you look really close, you can see the other three to the left of the building.

Picnic site.  It doesn't get much better than this.

The field was full of these tiny wildflower gems.

I told them all to point into the distance...and they did.

Crumbly old barn, so full of texture and cool evening light.

They call this their "Million Dollar Well"  (Jazz hands...)
