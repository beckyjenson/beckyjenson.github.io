We have been receiving alot of compliments on our (well, Becky's) "Image of the Day" posts. Many of them have been exhortations to make an Etsy.com site to sell prints. Finally we gave in and created an account ([http://bagdanoffphoto.etsy.com](http://bagdanoffphoto.etsy.com)). I have uploaded 10 select images and we plan on making them each a limited run of 10 prints each.
