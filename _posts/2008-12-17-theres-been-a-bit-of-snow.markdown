And we are pretty much stuck at our house! We took a little neighborhood walk and I snapped a few images with my little point and shoot. At the time of this walk there was about 12 inches of snow with a 1 inch ice layer on top (and another inch on the bottom). The snow has resumed and is now adding another layer!
