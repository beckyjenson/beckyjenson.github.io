We got to spend some time in a lovely park Sunday evening and got to photograph a fun little family. We will be shooting R&S’s wedding in a couple weeks, but they wanted a “practice run” first. Their daughter came along and was tucked in to several poses, with great effect ![:)](http://blog.bagdanoffphoto.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
