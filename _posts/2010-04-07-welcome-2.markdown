Hi there and welcome to Becky Jenson Photography.  This is the same Becky from Bagdanoff Photo, just now with a new business look and a new focus.  I've moved out to a gorgeous patch of land in Washougal, WA, and am busy setting up a photo playland for portrait shoots of all kinds.  Join me as I work to discover what the word "portraiture" means to me and the people I am privileged to shoot.  I will also be exploring my personal love of photography and sharing my unique views of the way light hits the world around me.
